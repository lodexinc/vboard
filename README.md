vboard by The VS Organisation
======

We have created a simple plugin for the virtual keyboard that can be integrated with any website to allow accessibilty to the users.

This can be downloaded as .zip file and then saved in the site.

Make sure you are correct while linking the files in the Layout, and then go to your site click on any input field and Voila! An imaginary keyboard will popup.

Thanks, do help us by giving the error reports and feedback on how we can organise it and make it better!
